// DMG Calc stuff
// PKMN DMG CALC
function pkmnDmgCalc (skill, user, target) {
    let critical = 1
    let random = rndInt(85, 100)/100; console.log(random + ' ' + user.level)
    let power = skill.power
    let dmg = ( (2 * user.level / 5) * power * user.dmg/target.def ) / 50
    console.log(dmg)
    dmg = dmg * critical * random

    console.log(`${skill.name} did ${dmg} dmg`)
