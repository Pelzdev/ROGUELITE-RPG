### BUFFS ###
- BUFFS' timeLeft is number of events left, every event that ends lowers it by 1
- Drunk buff added, does nothing for now.

### Attribute stuff ###
CHR now gives a discount on trainers and inn costs (-chr to gold cost)
END now gives more hp
INT now gives more exp
LCK gives chance to crit

###Agoknee tips:###

eliminate these lines. add one single <script> tag to your <head> (main.js). ideally you add type="module" and start using modules, but at least add defer
inside main.js, import the other scripts (at the top)

get rid of all the JS in your HTML. move it all to main.js (or an appropriate module imported by main.js) using addEventListener().

could combine these into a single event listener/handler (event delegation)

could combine these into a single button element and a single event listener/handler




// DMG Calc stuff
//Current 
let dmgCalcCURRENT = Math.round(skill.power/5 * attrMulti) // if pow is 30 and attr 10: 6.6 | if pow is 60 and attr is 20: 14.4
let dmgCalcNEW = (skill.power/5 + user.dmg) * attrMulti // if pow 30, dmg is 5 and attr 10: does 12.1 | if pow 30, dmg is 8 and attr 10: does 15,4





// PKMN DMG CALC
function pkmnDmgCalc (skill, user, target) {
    let critical = 1
    let random = rndInt(85, 100)/100; console.log(random + ' ' + user.level)
    let power = skill.power
    let dmg = ( (2 * user.level / 5) * power * user.dmg/target.def ) / 50
    console.log(dmg)
    dmg = dmg * critical * random

    console.log(`${skill.name} did ${dmg} dmg`)
}
